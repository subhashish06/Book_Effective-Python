# Book_Effective-Python

This repo tracks my progress as I go through the "Effective Python: 59 specific ways to write better code" by Brett Stalkin.

This is not a reproduction of the entire book. I will practice the specific ways mentioned in the book and keep this repo as a ready reckoner for when needed.
